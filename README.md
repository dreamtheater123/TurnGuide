This work introduces an end-to-end full-duplex speech language model and strengthens its capabilities to generate coherent, meaningful full duplex dialogues. As an initial release, we provide the test splits from the Fisher and Candor datasets to support fair and straightforward benchmarking for future research.

Examples:
- Fisher: `fe_03_11632_60_180.wav`
    - ID: `fe_03_11632`
    - Time segment: 60-180s
- Candor: `46f8e9b8-f80a-48cf-90a0-2e29908202c0_420.0_540.0.wav`
    - ID: `46f8e9b8-f80a-48cf-90a0-2e29908202c0`
    - Time segment: 420-540s

Download [Fisher](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004S13) and [Candor](https://guscooney.com/candor-dataset/) datasets.

Model checkpoints and supporting code will be released in the future as we are still improving the modelâ€”stay tuned for updates!
